# 👋 Hi, I'm Danial Saljoughian-Esfahani  

🚀 **Software Engineering student @ University of Toronto (CS, ’27)**  
🎯 Actively seeking a **12-month SWE Co-op (Sep 2025 – Sep 2026)** in **Toronto**  

I enjoy building **production-like systems** that mix full-stack engineering with machine learning.  
Currently, I’m working on projects involving **deep learning, real-time pipelines, and scalable web apps.**  

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack  
- **Languages**: Python, Java, C, TypeScript/JavaScript  
- **Web**: React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, Tailwind  
- **ML/Data**: TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy  
- **DevOps/Tools**: Docker, GitHub Actions, MongoDB, Linux, REST APIs

## 🛠 Featured Projects  

### 📘 MarkAI
*AI-assisted assignment marking platform*  
- Built with **Next.js, React, Tailwind, Node.js, Docker**  
- Integrated **ChatGPT API** for semantic grading  
- Added **CI/CD pipelines + unit tests** to ensure stability
